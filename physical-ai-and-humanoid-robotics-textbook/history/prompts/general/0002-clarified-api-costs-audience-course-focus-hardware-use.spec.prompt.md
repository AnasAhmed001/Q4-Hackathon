## Prompt

[Previous user prompt for /sp.clarify]

## Response snapshot

Questions have been asked and answered for:
- API Costs (Module 4)
- Target Audience Background
- Course Focus
- Physical Hardware Use

- API Costs (Module 4): Students cover costs
- Target Audience Background: Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering
- Course Focus: Survey course (breadth)
- Physical Hardware Use: Some physical hardware required

Updates have been applied to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and `specs/1-vision-language-action-module/spec.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified critical aspects of API costs, target audience, course focus, and physical hardware usage, updating the constitution and relevant module spec to reflect these decisions.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md, specs/1-vision-language-action-module/spec.md updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue clarification process with remaining critical and high-priority questions.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully gathered and integrated another set of critical clarifications. The ongoing task is to systematically address all remaining clarification points from the initial `/sp.clarify` request.
