# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 2: The Digital Twin

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](specs/1-digital-twin-module/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) _(Note: Mentions of Gazebo, SDF, Unity, ROS-Unity bridge, ML-Agents are necessary as they are the core subject matter and constraints of this technical module specification.)_
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders _(Note: This spec is intentionally technical, targeting students with basic Python/AI/ML knowledge, as per the module's defined audience.)_
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) _(Note: Mentions of Gazebo, SDF, Unity, ROS-Unity bridge are necessary as they are core subject matter and constraints.)_
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification _(Note: Mentions of Gazebo, SDF, Unity, ROS-Unity bridge, ML-Agents are necessary as they are the core subject matter and constraints of this technical module specification.)_

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
