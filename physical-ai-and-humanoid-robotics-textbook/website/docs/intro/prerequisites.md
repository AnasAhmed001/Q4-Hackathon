# Prerequisites

To get the most out of this textbook and successfully complete the practical exercises, students are expected to have the following foundational knowledge and skills:

## Foundational Skills

*   **Intermediate Python Proficiency**: This includes a solid understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, effective error handling, modular code design, and familiarity with common Python libraries. While advanced topics like `async/await` are not strictly required, a strong grasp of Python fundamentals is essential.

*   **Linux Command Line Familiarity**: Experience with basic Linux commands (e.g., `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `chmod`) is assumed, particularly for navigating the file system, managing processes, and interacting with ROS 2 tools on Ubuntu.

*   **Basic Robotics Concepts**: Students should have an introductory understanding of fundamental robotics concepts, including different types of robots, common sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, IMUs), and actuators (e.g., motors, servos). Knowledge of basic kinematics and control theory will be beneficial but not strictly required as the course will cover relevant aspects.

*   **Basic AI/ML Concepts**: A general understanding of core artificial intelligence and machine learning principles, such as supervised learning, neural networks, and basic data handling, will be helpful, especially in modules focusing on AI-Robot Brain and Vision-Language-Action systems. No advanced ML expertise is assumed.

## Software & Tools

*   **Version Control with Git**: Familiarity with Git for version control, including cloning repositories, committing changes, branching, and merging, is crucial for managing project code.

*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: While not strictly required, using an IDE like VS Code with relevant extensions (e.g., Python, ROS, Docker) is highly recommended for efficient development and debugging.

## Mathematical Background

*   **Basic Calculus and Linear Algebra**: A fundamental understanding of vectors, matrices, derivatives, and integrals will aid in comprehending some of the underlying principles of robotics and AI, particularly in areas like kinematics, dynamics, and optimization. No advanced mathematical proofs are required.
